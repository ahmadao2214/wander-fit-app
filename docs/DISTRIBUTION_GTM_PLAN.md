# Distribution & Go-To-Market Plan

> Non-technical strategy based on advisor feedback from Loukman (January 2026)

## Executive Summary

This document captures the business development, distribution, and go-to-market insights from Loukman's feedback. These are the non-technical action items that need iteration and execution alongside product development.

**Core Insight:** The app's value proposition is giving junior athletes access to elite-level programming they wouldn't otherwise have—enabling them to reach the next level in their athletic career.

---

## Target User Definition

### Primary User: The Aspiring Junior Athlete

**Loukman's Note:** "Young people that need the app are the young junior athlete who are desperately wanting to become the elite junior athlete so they can qualify for the next level in their career"

#### User Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Age** | 10-17 years old |
| **Mindset** | Highly motivated, wants to "go pro" or reach elite level |
| **Current situation** | Good at their sport but needs edge over competition |
| **Pain point** | Lacks access to professional-level training programs |
| **Goal** | Qualify for elite academy, travel team, or next competitive tier |
| **Decision maker** | Parent (pays, approves) but athlete drives the "want" |

#### What They're Looking For
- [ ] Structured training that feels "professional"
- [ ] Clear path to improvement
- [ ] Visible progress they can point to
- [ ] Something their competitors don't have
- [ ] Credibility (science-backed, used by real athletes)

### Action Items: User Research

| Action | Owner | Status | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Interview 5 junior athletes about training habits | | ⬜ TODO | What do they currently do? What's missing? |
| Interview 5 sports parents about spending/decisions | | ⬜ TODO | What would make them pay? What are concerns? |
| Survey local club athletes (10-15 responses) | | ⬜ TODO | Validate pain points and willingness to use app |
| Create user persona document | | ⬜ TODO | Synthesize research into actionable personas |

### Open Questions
- [ ] What specific "next level" are they trying to reach? (Club → Academy? JV → Varsity? Regional → National?)
- [ ] What's the typical age when athletes get serious about advancement?
- [ ] What sports have the clearest "pathway" structure?
- [ ] Are parents or athletes the primary driver of training decisions?

---

## Distribution Strategy

### Channel 1: Local Academies

**Loukman's Note:** "Look at local academy for distribution, a little bit higher than a club"

#### What is a "Local Academy"?
- More selective than recreational clubs
- Often serves as feeder to elite programs
- Athletes are serious, paying for advancement
- Examples: IMG Academy feeders, soccer development academies, baseball training facilities

#### Why Academies?

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Pre-qualified audience | Athletes already investing in development |
| Higher price tolerance | Parents already paying premium for training |
| Built-in credibility | Academy endorsement = trust |
| Concentrated distribution | One partnership = many users |
| Word of mouth | Competitive athletes talk to each other |

#### Academy Partnership Model Options

**Option A: Direct Partnership**
- Academy officially recommends/requires app
- Revenue share or licensing fee
- App branded or co-branded with academy
- Pros: Deep integration, guaranteed users
- Cons: Longer sales cycle, customization requests

**Option B: Coach Referral**
- Individual coaches recommend to their athletes
- Affiliate commission per sign-up
- Pros: Faster to start, grassroots growth
- Cons: Less official, inconsistent adoption

**Option C: Free Pilot Program**
- Offer free access to one academy cohort
- Collect testimonials and data
- Convert to paid after proving value
- Pros: Lower barrier, proof of concept
- Cons: Need to convert free to paid

#### Action Items: Academy Distribution

| Action | Owner | Status | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Research: List 10 local academies in target region | | ⬜ TODO | Focus on sports we support |
| Research: Identify decision makers at each | | ⬜ TODO | Athletic director? Head coach? Owner? |
| Create academy pitch deck | | ⬜ TODO | Value prop, partnership models, case studies |
| Reach out to 3 academies for pilot conversations | | ⬜ TODO | Start with warmest connections |
| Define pilot program structure | | ⬜ TODO | Duration, success metrics, conversion path |

- [ ] What does an academy need to see before recommending a product?
- [ ] Are there liability/insurance concerns with recommending training apps?

---

### Channel 2: Clubs (Discovery & Research)

**Loukman's Note:** "Go to a club and find out how to share your app while asking them what they're looking for to benefit from you/your app"

#### Approach: Learn Before You Sell

This is a **discovery mission**, not a sales pitch. Goals:
1. Understand what clubs actually need
2. Learn how decisions get made
3. Identify pain points we can solve
4. Build relationships for future partnerships

#### Discovery Questions for Clubs

**For Club Administrators:**
- What tools do you currently use for athlete development?
- What's your biggest challenge with athlete training outside practice?
- How do parents typically engage with their child's development?
- Would you recommend a training app to your athletes? Why/why not?
- What would make you recommend a product to your athletes?

**For Coaches:**
- How do you currently prescribe off-field training?
- Do athletes actually do the training you recommend?
- What would help you track athlete compliance?
- What features would make your job easier?

**For Parents (at clubs):**
- What are you looking for to help your child improve?
- What training does your child do outside of practice?
- What would make you pay for a training app?
- What concerns would you have about a training app for your child?

#### Action Items: Club Research

| Attend 2 club events as observer | | ⬜ TODO | Watch parent-coach-athlete dynamics |
| Synthesize findings into insights doc | | ⬜ TODO | What did we learn? What to build? |

### Open Questions
- [ ] What's the best way to approach a club? (Cold email? Show up? Mutual connection?)
- [ ] Who at a club is the right person to talk to?
- [ ] Are clubs protective of their athletes or open to outside resources?

## Value Proposition & Messaging

**Loukman's Note:** "Building an app to give kids an edge to give a workout program that without the app they would never have—that would enable them to get into the next elite sports academy"

### Core Value Proposition

> **Wander-Fit gives junior athletes access to the same periodized training programs used by elite athletes—so they can qualify for the academies, travel teams, and opportunities that will define their athletic career.**

### Messaging Framework

| Audience | Pain Point | Our Solution | Outcome |
|----------|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Athlete** | "I train hard but don't know if I'm doing the right things" | Structured, phase-based programming | "Now I have a plan like the pros" |
| **Parent** | "I want to help my kid succeed but don't know how" | Visibility into training, progress tracking | "I can see they're on the right track" |
| **Coach** | "I can't monitor what athletes do outside practice" | Compliance tracking, program consistency | "My athletes come to practice prepared" |
| **Academy** | "We need athletes who are physically prepared" | Pre-academy preparation programs | "Athletes arrive ready to compete" |

### Key Messages by Channel

**For Social/Ads (Athletes):**
- "Train like the athletes who made it"
- "Your competition isn't just at practice"
- "The program that gets you to the next level"

**For Parents:**
- "Give your child the training edge"
- "See the progress, know the plan"
- "Professional programming, designed for young athletes"

**For Academies/Clubs:**
- "Prepare athletes before they arrive"
- "Extend your training beyond practice"
- "Track athlete development year-round"
