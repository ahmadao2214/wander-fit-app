# Wander-Fit Market Validation Plan

## Executive Summary

**Goal:** Validate product-market fit for Wander-Fit among 14-17 year-old athletes by conducting discovery interviews with youth clubs, coaches, and athletic organizations.

**Target Demographics:**
- **Primary:** 14-17 year-olds seeking structured athletic conditioning
- **Secondary:** 18-35 year-olds looking for sport-specific training

**Key Hypothesis to Validate:**
> Young athletes (14-17) who want to make varsity teams or elite sport clubs are actively seeking structured conditioning programs, and would benefit from a sport-specific, periodized training app.

## Part 2: Discovery Interview Questions

### Section A: Understanding Current State (For Club Leaders/Coaches)

**Awareness Questions:**
1. "Have you noticed any youth athletes (14-17) who've expressed interest in getting stronger, faster, or improving their conditioning outside of practice?"
2. "Do any of your athletes currently do additional strength or conditioning training on their own?"
3. "Have any athletes mentioned going to the gym or following workout programs?"
4. "What do athletes typically do in the off-season to prepare for the next season?"

**Behavior Questions:**
5. "When athletes ask you how to get faster/stronger, what do you typically tell them?"
6. "Have you ever recommended any apps, programs, or resources for conditioning?"
7. "Do parents ever ask you about training recommendations for their kids?"
8. "What do your most dedicated athletes do differently than others?"

**Gap/Problem Questions:**
9. "What's the biggest challenge you see when athletes try to train on their own?"
10. "Have you seen athletes get injured from improper training?"
11. "Do you think most 14-17 year-olds know how to structure a proper training program?"
12. "What do you wish your athletes had access to that they currently don't?"

### Section B: Validating the Solution (After Describing the App)

**Interest Questions:**
13. "If there was a free program that gave athletes a 12-week, sport-specific training plan, do you think any of your athletes would use it?"
14. "What features would make something like this valuable to your athletes?"
15. "Would age-appropriate intensity (so a 14-year-old isn't training like an 18-year-old) be important?"
16. "How important is it that the training is specific to their sport vs. general fitness?"

**Barrier Questions:**
17. "What might prevent an athlete from using a training app?"
18. "Would parents need to approve something like this?"
19. "Do your athletes have gym access, or would bodyweight programs be more practical?"
20. "What time of year would athletes be most likely to use this?"

**Referral Questions:**
21. "Do you know 2-3 athletes who would be good to talk to about this?"
22. "Are there other coaches or organizations you'd recommend I speak with?"
23. "Would you be interested in piloting this with a few of your athletes?"

### Section C: For Direct Athlete/Parent Interviews

**For Athletes (14-17):**
1. "What's your main sport and what are your goals for next season?"
2. "Do you currently do any training outside of team practices?"
3. "If yes, how do you decide what exercises to do?"
4. "Have you ever wished you had a plan to follow instead of just going to the gym and figuring it out?"
5. "Do you track your workouts anywhere? (Notes app, journal, nothing?)"
6. "What would motivate you to stick with a training program?"
7. "Would you use an app that gave you daily workouts specific to your sport?"

**For Parents:**
1. "Does your child do any conditioning outside of team practice?"
2. "Have they ever asked about going to the gym or getting a training program?"
3. "What concerns would you have about your teen following a fitness program?"
4. "Would knowing the program is age-appropriate (designed for 14-17 year-olds) matter to you?"
5. "Would you pay for something like this, or would free be necessary for them to try it?"

### Section D: Wander-Fit Specific Feature Validation

Based on app features, validate these specific elements:

| Feature | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **Sport-specific training** | "How important is it that workouts are designed for [their sport] vs. general fitness?" |
| **12-week periodization** | "Would a 12-week progressive program (building foundation first, then intensity) appeal to you?" |
| **Phase progression (GPP→SPP→SSP)** | "Would you want to unlock harder phases only after completing easier ones, or have access to everything?" |
| **1RM tracking** | "Do you know your max for bench press, squat, or deadlift? Would tracking this be useful?" |
| **Age-appropriate intensity** | "Would knowing the weight recommendations are safe for your age group matter?" |
| **Progress streaks** | "Would seeing a 'streak' of consecutive workouts motivate you to keep going?" |
| **Exercise instructions** | "How important are video/text instructions for how to do exercises correctly?" |

## Part 3: Outreach Strategy & Scripts

### Email Template for Club Directors

```
Subject: Quick question about youth athlete conditioning at [Club Name]

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], co-founder of a youth athletic development project. We're researching how young athletes (14-17) approach conditioning outside of team practice.

I'd love 15 minutes of your time to ask a few questions about what you've observed with your athletes. I'm not selling anything—just trying to understand the landscape before building something that could help.

Specifically curious about:
- Whether athletes ask about strength/conditioning programs
- What resources (if any) they currently use
- What gaps you see in youth athletic development

Would you have time for a quick call this week or next?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
[Phone]
```

### Cold DM Template (Instagram/Social)

```
Hey [Name]! I noticed you work with youth athletes at [Club/Facility].

Quick question: Do you see many 14-17 year-olds asking about strength & conditioning programs? We're researching what young athletes actually want before building something.

Would love to hear your perspective if you have 5 min sometime. No sales pitch—just gathering info.
```

### In-Person Script (Sideline/Event Networking)

"Hey, I'm [Name]. My co-founder and I are building an app for youth athletes and we're trying to validate whether it's actually needed. Can I ask you a quick question?

[If yes]: Have you seen any athletes around 14-17 who seem really motivated to get stronger or faster? Like, they're asking about gym workouts or trying to do extra conditioning?

[Listen, then follow up based on their response]"

## Part 5: What Success Looks Like

### Strong Validation Signals:
- 7+ out of 10 coaches say they see athletes asking about conditioning
- Athletes can articulate specific goals (make varsity, get faster, etc.)
- Current solutions are described as inadequate (generic programs, no progression)
- Interest in sport-specific training over general fitness
- Athletes already track workouts (even informally)
- Coaches offer to pilot with their athletes

### Weak/Negative Signals:
- Coaches say athletes aren't interested in extra training
- Athletes are satisfied with YouTube/Instagram workouts
- Price sensitivity is extreme (won't use even if free)
- Gym access is a major barrier
- Coaches see conditioning as their domain (territorial)

### Questions to Answer After Research:

1. **Is there demand?** Do 14-17 year-olds actually want structured conditioning?
2. **What's the entry point?** Free spreadsheet? Free app? Freemium?
3. **Who's the buyer?** Athlete? Parent? Coach? Club?
4. **What sport category has highest demand?** Soccer? Basketball? Multi-sport?
5. **What features matter most?** Sport-specific? Progress tracking? Social/competitive?
6. **What are the barriers?** Time? Gym access? Knowledge? Motivation?

## Part 6: Alternative Outreach Ideas

### Beyond Traditional Clubs:

| Channel | Approach | Potential |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Reddit** | r/youthsports, r/soccerparents, sport-specific subs | Anonymous research, large sample |
| **Facebook Groups** | "Youth Soccer Parents [City]" type groups | Parent perspective access |
| **Instagram Hashtags** | #youthathlete, #highschoolsoccer, #sportstraining | Find motivated athletes directly |
| **YouTube Comments** | On youth training videos | See what questions are asked |
| **High School Sports Reporters** | Local newspapers/sites | Understand local sports culture |
| **Sports Medicine Clinics** | Partner for research | Access to injured athletes wanting to return stronger |
| **Church Athletic Leagues** | CYO, etc. | Underserved demographic |
| **Homeschool Athletic Associations** | Often overlooked | May have higher motivation |
| **Club Showcase Events** | Tournaments, showcases | High concentration of motivated athletes/parents |
| **Speed/Agility Camp Directors** | Summer camp operators | Already serving this market |

### Unconventional Validation:

1. **Create a "Waiting List" Landing Page**: See if people actually sign up
2. **Offer Free Spreadsheet Program First**: Validate engagement before app
3. **Partner with 1 Coach for Pilot**: 5-10 athletes using the app, get feedback
4. **Run a Free 4-Week Challenge**: Instagram campaign, track completion rates
5. **Survey via Google Forms**: Post in relevant Facebook groups

---

## Part 7: Key Risks to Probe

During interviews, specifically probe these risks:

| Risk | Question to Validate |
|------|---------------------|
| **Kids won't use apps for training** | "Do your athletes use any fitness apps currently?" |
| **Parents control device usage** | "Would parents need to approve an app like this?" |
| **No gym access** | "Do your athletes have access to gyms or weight rooms?" |
| **Coaches feel threatened** | "Would you see this as helpful or competing with your coaching?" |
| **Seasonality kills retention** | "When would athletes most likely use this—off-season or during season?" |
| **Generic YouTube is good enough** | "What's wrong with just following YouTube workouts?" |

---

## Appendix: Wander-Fit Feature Summary (For Reference)

When describing the app to interviewees:

**Core Features:**
- Sport-specific workouts (29 sports, 4 training categories)
- 12-week periodized program (GPP → SPP → SSP)
- Age-appropriate intensity scaling (14-17 vs 18+)
- Progress tracking (streaks, completion, 1RM)
- Exercise library with instructions
- Workout execution logging (reps, weight, RPE)

**Differentiators:**
- Not generic fitness—designed for athletes
- Progressive unlock system (can't skip to advanced)
- Educational content explaining "why" behind training
- Built-in periodization (no guesswork)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan with co-founder**
2. **Prioritize which categories to target first**
3. **Build outreach spreadsheet**
4. **Draft personalized emails for top 10 targets**
5. **Set interview scheduling goal (e.g., 10 interviews in 2 weeks)**
6. **Create simple interview note template**
7. **Schedule weekly sync to review learnings**
